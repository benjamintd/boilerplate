# Boilerplate

This boilerplate repository should get you started for some opinionated web development.
It is a Next app packed with linting, tailwind CSS and custom fonts.

It uses SWR to handle server requests and asynchronous data.

We use Typescript and VSCode to take advantage of typing and auto-complete.

## Installation

Clone this repo, then run:
`yarn && yarn dev`

You can then head to `localhost:3000`.
