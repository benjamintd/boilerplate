# Boilerplate

This boilerplate repository should get you started for some opinionated web development.
It is a Next app packed with linting, tailwind CSS and custom fonts.

It uses redux and sagas to handle actions and asynchronicity.

We use Typescript and VSCode to take advantage of typing and auto-complete.

## Installation

Clone this repo, then run:
`yarn && yarn dev`

You can then head to `localhost:3000`.
